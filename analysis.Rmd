##Intro
This notebook reverses the data from the RSIs. For that we need to divides= it by userclas (bussiness, commuting, other, (maybe more as it matches up with the tempro data) LGV, HGV) and Time Period. 

The trip porpuse can be obtained from a combination of origin purpose and destination purpose.
